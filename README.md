# Student-Mental-Health-Analysis-and-Prediction
This repository focuses on analyzing and classifying the mental health status of students using the Student Mental Health Analysis dataset. Mental health plays a crucial role in the overall well-being and academic success of students. By applying machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. 

## 📝 Problem Statement

Mental health is a critical factor that affects students' academic performance and overall well-being. This project focuses on building a classification model to identify the mental health status of students based on survey data. Early detection can help in providing timely support and interventions.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains survey responses from students, including demographic details, academic data, lifestyle habits, and mental health indicators. It may contain missing values which have been handled appropriately during preprocessing.

## 🚀 Approach

- 🔄 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and statistical analysis to understand feature relationships.
- 🤖 Modeling: Using **Random Forest Classifier** algorithm for classification due to its robustness and ability to handle nonlinear relationships and feature importance.
- 📊 Model Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are used to evaluate performance.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used

- 🐍 Python
- 📚 Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
- 📉 Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
- 🤖 Scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms and evaluation)
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook (development environment)
